.Sh NAME
.Nm nfc-emulate-forum-tag4
.Nd NFC Forum tag type 4 emulation command line demonstration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op -1
.Op infile Op outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
is a demonstration tool that emulates a NFC Forum tag type 4 v2.0 (or v1.0) with NDEF content.
.Pp
.Ar -1
can be provided to force old Tag Type 4 version 1.0 behavior.
.Pp
.Ar infile
is the file which contains NDEF message you want to share with the NFC-Forum
compliant initiator device (e.g. Nokia 6212 Classic for a v1.0 tag)
.Pp
If you want to save a shared content by the initiator device, we have to give 
.Ar outfile
argument to point where the NDEF message will be saved.
.Pp
This example uses the hardware capability of PN532 to handle ISO/IEC 14443-4
low-level frames like RATS/ATS, WTX, etc.
.Pp
All devices compliant with NFC-Forum Tag Type 4 (Version 2.0 or 1.0) can be used with
this example in read-write mode.
.Pp
If no argument is given, a default NDEF file is available.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
You can specify the same 
.Ar infile
and 
.Ar outfile
.Sh IMPORTANT
Only PN532 equipped devices can use this example. (e.g. PN532 breakout board)
.Pp
ACR122 devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this example, but if
something goes wrong, you will have to unplug/replug your device.
This is not a
.Em libnfc's
bug, this problem is due to ACR122's internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).
