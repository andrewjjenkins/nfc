.Sh NAME
.Nm nfc-emulate-forum-tag2
.Nd NFC Forum tag type 2 emulation command line demonstration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
is a demonstration tool that emulates a NFC-Forum Tag Type 2 with NDEF content.
.Pp
Some devices compliant with NFC-Forum Tag Type 2 can be used with this example,
in read mode only.
.Sh IMPORTANT
This example has been developed using PN533 USB hardware as target and Google
Nexus S phone as initiator.
.Pp
This is know to NOT work with Nokia 6212 Classic and could fail with several
NFC Forum compliant devices due to the following reasons:
.Pp
- The emulated target has only a 4-byte UID while most devices assume a
Tag Type 2 has always a 7-byte UID (as a real Mifare Ultralight tag);
.Pp
- The chip is emulating an ISO/IEC 14443-3 tag, without any hardware helper.
If the initiator have too strict timeouts for software-based emulation
(which is usually the case), this example will fail.
This is not a bug and we can't do anything using this hardware (PN531/PN533).
.Pp
ACR122 devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this example, but if
something goes wrong, you will have to unplug/replug your device.
This is not a
.Em libnfc's
bug, this problem is due to ACR122's internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).
